# js_game
Repository for game project written in JavaScript. Game will be a text based RPG/fighting game. 
There will be multiple classes that have advantages and disadvantages, like the classes in Dungeons and Dragons.
Players can choose any class they like and will be given appropriate inventories, then sent to fight a small enemy, 
such as a goblin, that is randomly generated from a list.

The player will be prompted to build a character at the start, then they will fight a Goblin to learn the controls. There will be tutorial notes
to help the player learn what to do. Players have a couple actions to take: Attack, Dodge, Heal, and Run. Players start off with 4 Heal potions, and can't exceed their maximum hp.

After the tutorial, enemies will randomly be generated until the player is defeated or ends the simulation.

There should be a GUI display with sprites and action buttons for the user.
